This GitHub repository will replace [classic IIDDA](https://davidearn.mcmaster.ca/iidda), which is currently offline.

You can browse the available data [here](https://github.com/canmod/iidda/tree/main/data).

## Comprehensive Canadian Data Digitization Project

We are building a Canadian data portal that will provide straightforward and convenient access to all historical public Canadian infectious disease data.

We are systematically collecting historical infectious disease data from provincial and territorial agencies.

Data from before 1990 are on hard copies (some handwritten like in the example picture above). We are digitizing and compiling these hard copies into convenient data files.

The data from this project will appear here in IIDDA, but is not yet here.

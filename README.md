# International Infectious Disease Data Archive (IIDDA)

We are building a Canadian data portal that will provide straightforward and convenient access to all historical public Canadian infectious disease data.

We are systematically collecting historical infectious disease data from provincial and territorial agencies.

Data from before 1990 are on hard copies (some handwritten like in the example picture above). We are digitizing and compiling these hard copies into convenient data files.

We are aiming to connect these historical data to current (public) data as well.

Although our focus is on Canadian data, some data from outside of Canada will appear here as well.

This GitHub repository will replace [classic IIDDA](https://davidearn.mcmaster.ca/iidda), which is currently offline.

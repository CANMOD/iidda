For example, if a case count is reported for a country (e.g. Canada) but only certain jurisdictions within that country (e.g. provinces) have contributed data, then the population_reported is the sum of the populations of the contributing jurisdictions. This field can be useful for normalizing by population size in instances when the total population is not representative of the count.",

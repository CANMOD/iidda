  "description": "Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics,Canadian Mortality Database (CMDB), 1970 to 1979. Estimates are rounded using the controlled rounding process for confidentiality purposes. The sum of values for each category may differ from the total due to rounding. The zero values do not necessarily equate to a true zero due to the rounding process. Counts in this table exclude deaths of non-residents of Canada. Totals will not match published annual counts because the cut-off week will include deaths from one or more days of the previous or following year.  Causes of deaths followed the convention of the World Health Organization (WHO), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Sixth Revision (ICD-6) for 1950 to 1957 and Seventh Revision (ICD-7) for 1958 and 1959. The cause of death tabulated is the underlying cause of death. This is defined as (a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury. This underlying cause is selected from a number of conditions listed on the death registration form.",
